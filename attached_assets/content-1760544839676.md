# Rules of Hooks [Link for this heading](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning\#undefined "Link for this heading")

You are probably here because you got the following error message:

Console

Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component.

There are three common reasons you might be seeing it:

1. You might be **breaking the Rules of Hooks**.
2. You might have **mismatching versions** of React and React DOM.
3. You might have **more than one copy of React** in the same app.

Let’s look at each of these cases.

## Breaking Rules of Hooks [Link for Breaking Rules of Hooks ](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning\#breaking-rules-of-hooks "Link for Breaking Rules of Hooks ")

Functions whose names start with `use` are called [_Hooks_](https://react.dev/reference/react) in React.

**Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.** Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is rendering a function component:

- ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a [function component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component).
- ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a [custom Hook](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

```sp-pre-placeholder grow-[2]

```

It’s **not** supported to call Hooks (functions starting with `use`) in any other cases, for example:

- 🔴 Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks after a conditional `return` statement.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks in event handlers.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks in class components.
- 🔴 Do not call Hooks inside functions passed to `useMemo`, `useReducer`, or `useEffect`.

If you break these rules, you might see this error.

```sp-pre-placeholder grow-[2]

```

You can use the [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to catch these mistakes.

### Note

[Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) _may_ call other Hooks (that’s their whole purpose). This works because custom Hooks are also supposed to only be called while a function component is rendering.

## Mismatching Versions of React and React DOM [Link for Mismatching Versions of React and React DOM ](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning\#mismatching-versions-of-react-and-react-dom "Link for Mismatching Versions of React and React DOM ")

You might be using a version of `react-dom` (< 16.8.0) or `react-native` (< 0.59) that doesn’t yet support Hooks. You can run `npm ls react-dom` or `npm ls react-native` in your application folder to check which version you’re using. If you find more than one of them, this might also create problems (more on that below).

## Duplicate React [Link for Duplicate React ](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning\#duplicate-react "Link for Duplicate React ")

In order for Hooks to work, the `react` import from your application code needs to resolve to the same module as the `react` import from inside the `react-dom` package.

If these `react` imports resolve to two different exports objects, you will see this warning. This may happen if you **accidentally end up with two copies** of the `react` package.

If you use Node for package management, you can run this check in your project folder:

Terminal

Copy

npm ls react

If you see more than one React, you’ll need to figure out why this happens and fix your dependency tree. For example, maybe a library you’re using incorrectly specifies `react` as a dependency (rather than a peer dependency). Until that library is fixed, [Yarn resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) is one possible workaround.

You can also try to debug this problem by adding some logs and restarting your development server:

```sp-pre-placeholder grow-[2]

```

If it prints `false` then you might have two Reacts and need to figure out why that happened. [This issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991) includes some common reasons encountered by the community.

This problem can also come up when you use `npm link` or an equivalent. In that case, your bundler might “see” two Reacts — one in application folder and one in your library folder. Assuming `myapp` and `mylib` are sibling folders, one possible fix is to run `npm link ../myapp/node_modules/react` from `mylib`. This should make the library use the application’s React copy.

### Note

In general, React supports using multiple independent copies on one page (for example, if an app and a third-party widget both use it). It only breaks if `require('react')` resolves differently between the component and the `react-dom` copy it was rendered with.

## Other Causes [Link for Other Causes ](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning\#other-causes "Link for Other Causes ")

If none of this worked, please comment in [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991) and we’ll try to help. Try to create a small reproducing example — you might discover the problem as you’re doing it.
